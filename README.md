# Geo Images Custom - Drupal Module
### A Drupal Module
that adds functional logics to Geo Images Media created with
[Drupal CMS Geo Images - Recipe](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_cms_geo_images)

Basically this generates a Geoimage Content / Node referencing each
Geo Image (geo_image) created throughout the automatic import via
[Media Library Importer module](https://www.drupal.org/project/media_library_importer)

This module:
- requires also the [pschocke/google-maps-links](https://github.com/pschocke/google-maps-links) php project to automatically
generate Google Maps links, from Geofield provided entities.
- also creates a new Drush command:\
```geo-images:delete (gid)```
that automatically removes / delete both GeoImages Content and GeoImages Media
entities generated by the automatic import.
